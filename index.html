                    Cities Unlocked is an app originally developed by Microsoft in collaboration with Guide Dogs UK.
                    It is designed for visually impaired people and works by describing what points of interest are around the user via speech from a headset.
                    Currently, there is no personalisation on the app and every user has the same places called out to them.
                    We were tasked with building a machine learning feature, which makes suggestions of places to go based on the user’s personality type.
                    We have built a web API that the Microsoft app can to make calls to when calling out places of interest, which in turn creates a more personalised experience for the user.

                <h3 style="text-align: justify">The Cities Unlocked project is the first of its kind, although there are mapping applications that provide speech callouts, none give the same freedom to explore a city like Cities Unlocked does. Because of the uniqueness of the project, the open requirements laid out by the client, and the lack of real-world training data, the project was as much of a research project in search for a problem as a development project creating a solution.

                <ul>
                    <h4><u> Discussion of Possible Problems </u></h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">A specific project direction was something that needed to be discussed and explored early on in the project, as the client hadn’t specified a particular direction. This was challenging due to the fact that the team wasn’t completely sure what was possible at that point and a balance had to be found between feasibility and utility. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">One idea that was put forth was a program that would spot patterns in behaviour and try to break this pattern. It was thought this would be of value to the user because they might be exposed to new activities instead of falling into a rut. Another idea was route suggestions through possible activities. The issue with the first problem was that we were unsure how best to distinguish a good habit from one that we might want to suggest an alternative for, especially without any data that can be analysed. As for the second problem, we didn’t think this fit well with the idea of the app. The app is not supposed to be a mapping tool, it should let the user explore by themselves. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">In the end elements of the two problems were combined. The pattern recognition aspect of the first was applied in a more general sense, it instead classifies users by personality and preference. The second problem was adapted to suggest activities in the vicinity of the user based on the personality class the user had been placed in by the first section.</p>

                    <h4> - Potential languages - </h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Two languages were discussed as the language of choice for this project. Java, and Python. Both languages are used extensively throughout industry and all members of the team were familiar with both. The choice was therefore not based on the team’s familiarity with the language but on the availability of project related resources.</p>

                                The JGibbLabelledLDA is a Java open-source library that implements the Labelled LDA model. The benefit of this library is that it has extensive documentation which is useful because the team does not have an in depth understanding of the LLDA model. The drawback is that compared to python, java is a lot more verbose.

                                The PythonLabelledLDA is a Python open-source library that implements the Labelled LDA model. Python allows the developer to write clear and concise code, something that is useful when prototyping, this is the library’s main benefit. Its major drawback is that documentation is lacking which makes this library hard to use.

                                PyMC3 is a python library for Bayesian statistical modelling that can be used to implement a BHM. The benefit of this library is that it gives the programmer a large amount of customizability whilst dealing with the complex calculations. The library however is harder to use than the other two in addition to it having a steeper learning curve for those new to statistical modelling.

                                The project makes use of other libraries however these were not researched as extensively as the three above because they did not affect the project in the same way the choice between JGibbLabelledLDA, PythonLabelledLDA, PyMC3 did. These libraries include Jackson, which is used for Java object to JSON conversions and the OSM4J library which is used to interact with OpenStreetMaps.

                            <p style="text-align: justify"> Multiple Machine Learning models and algorithms were considered as a basis for main functionality of the program. Initially a neural network was considered due to the team being told training data would be made available, when it became clear this would not be the case other models that did not need as much data needed to be considered.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                This firstly narrowed down to an implementation of a Bayesian Hierarchical  Model, coming after a period of thorough research of Bayesian probability, Bayesian networks, as well as the Open Street Maps tags that we would be using and methods of training data generation. We would require ‘trip’ data in order to train the model that we would have to randomly generate in a sensible way, as application real world data was not available. This would all conduct to an encapsulation of behaviour into personality types.</p><br>

                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                What followed was a change of approach due to the implementation method duration and complexity and allocated time frame. We found that we can use a Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to encapsulate behaviours in a simpler manner. Additionally, in this way we would be able to make use of library code otherwise unavailable to us, making the process more efficient and less prone to errors. We found a well documented library that would enable a proper and functional implementation. Furthermore, we created a training corpus to train the model and enable proper library use. </p><br>

                    <h4><u> Final Decision Summary </u></h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> Several aspects of the project needed to be decided upon. Firstly the decision was made to use an LLDA instead of BHM due to the fact that fewer assumptions about human personalities and the hierarchical nature of these personalities based on people’s behaviour had to be made. Additionally, the implementation of the LLDA was simpler due to the available libraries. This meant that more time could be spent working towards the requirements. The fact that fewer assumptions had to be made doesn’t guarantee better results because although the number of assumptions might be lower, the form of the assumptions that had to be made to fit the problem to the LLDA is different.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">The choice was made quite quickly to use the JGibbsLabelledLDA instead of the Python library. This was because the documentation was much more extensive for the former so we were more comfortable working with it. This in turn led us to choose Java as the main language for this project.
                        The research into frameworks was done after we had settled on the model and the ML library we would use. Due to this only Java frameworks were researched. We decided to use the Spring framework because rapid development and REST support were needed in order to meet our project goals, something JSP couldn’t give the same support for.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center">The final form of technologies used was based on a fusion of feasibility, practicality, efficiency and purpose achievement factors.</p>

Users wear a headset and receive audio cues and callouts informing them of their surroundings. These callouts may include shops, café’s, restaurants, and other notable points of interest.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">At the start of the project we were given a very open project description with only two things to keep in mind: the user is central, the solution needs a real-world outcome. In terms of the Cities Unlocked project we interpreted this to be improving or helping them with their experience.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">After discussion with our client and deliberation within the team we settled on the project goal: to help improve the user experience of the Cities Unlocked application by personalizing the information callouts based on user preferences.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            The nature of the project required us to develop a solution from scratch. In addition, consideration had to be taken of the fact that we did not possess any training data to apply any Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to.
                            Therefore, in discussion with the client we selected requirements that were both feasible within the timeframe and possible without the access to real-world data. More specifically, we deconstructed the problem into parts that could be viewed and worked on separately in order to give the project the best chance of success.

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            The Spring Boot framework allows for easy communication with MongoDB.
                            Due to this, and the form of the information that needed to be saved we chose to use Azure CosmosDB, a documentDB that supported the MongoDB API allowing us to use it alongside Spring.
                            The database contains two collections: Users and trainingData.

                            The application itself was built around the Spring Boot framework, packaged by Maven and hosted on an Azure Web App. The Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model (LLDA) is adapted library code to work within a web application instead of on the command line. The Spring Boot framework was chosen because it allows rapid development of enterprise level applications without too much up front configuration.

                            We have exposed a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) to our application and which allows any front end to connect with the application. In this case the API was built to integrate easily into the current Cities Unlocked application.

                            This section is key due to the fact that this is the section that adapts to user input and interaction, it defines a large part of the functionality of the system. The User class represents the user in the system and has its own model assigned to it. By calling methods on the user object the model learns and adapts. The model package includes several other classes that are used to help train the model however these are omitted for succinctness. What is shown in both user and model packages are the classes that persist in the database.

                                    The Template Method design pattern is a behavioural design pattern that allows common elements of similarly structured classes to be defined and consequently specialised by subclasses [1]. This promotes both loose coupling and reduces the duplication of code. The Template Method pattern promotes loose coupling of classes as well as reduces the duplication of code. However, it does limit one to use the skeleton of the existing superclass. Additionally, maintainability decreases as the number of methods increases [2].
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The Front Controller (FC) pattern is a variation of the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern in which all traffic is channelled through a single controller [3]. The MVC design pattern is an architectural pattern that separates the concerns of maintaining the User Interface (UI), the Model, and handling interactions between the two – the controller [4]. The benefits of a the FC Pattern is that duplication is reduced because all requests are handled in one place. Secondly, due to the centralized controller, thread safety is increased. Finally, is dynamic dispatching is employed, coupling can be reduced. There are however a few drawbacks of the pattern, one of which is that the controller may become a performance bottleneck. This is certainly a concern at high load and due to the nature of the application something that needs to be looked into. Another consideration is the added complexity of implementing the FC pattern, this is however handled by the Spring framework and less of a concern [5]. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows one to create objects without having to know the class or how to create it. An interface is defined and subclasses dictate how certain classes are instantiated through factory methods. This accommodates the configuration of the created object whilst hiding the complexity from the class that requires this object. The benefits of the factory method pattern are that it improves code readability by improving encapsulation and secondly if used well can decrease coupling through the use of the interface. In the case of the program allows the representation of the user to be changed without having to edit all the methods. The drawback is that coupling increases between the factory and the product i.e. the user, additionally as more types of product arise the maintainability of the factory is more tedious [6]. </p>

                                    The Template Method design pattern was applied to the classes in the requests sub-package of the scraper package. The initial decision was made to do this because the current subclasses duplicated a lot of code that could be factored out without introducing unnecessary coupling.

                                <p style="text-align: justify"> The Spring boot framework intrinsically uses the Front Controller pattern for web development. The APIController class is the controller and appropriately annotated with @RestController. Any view interacts with this APIController class which in turn interacts with the model. It also updates the view with any changes in the model. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"> All users within the system are created using a UserFactory. This is because the creation of a user requires a lot of configuration and users differ based on the configuration options that are sent in the request body. It is beneficial to hide this complexity from the ModelCoordinator class where Users are created because it concerns itself with the creation of the User object, not how they are created. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern abstracts and encapsulates the system’s interactions with a database. Additionally, it manages the connection that the system maintains with the database. There are several benefits to this pattern. Firstly, it decreases coupling with the database, this is beneficial because it makes enables easier migration and separates the concern of database implementation from the business logic. Secondly, it centralises all data access into a separate layer and reduces the complexity within the business layer by doing so. This is also a potential drawback, the DAO hides the expense at which these database calls are made [7]. In an application that makes database calls on each API request, this is definitely a concern. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The Singleton pattern is ensures that only one instance of an class can be instantiated. This is useful when it is imperative that only one of these objects exist in a system [8]. Singletons are a controversial design pattern however they are beneficial when an object is resource intense and the misuse of it or there being multiple instances of this object would introduce bugs. However the main drawback of the Singleton pattern is that code can become tightly coupled. It is therefore important to only make calls to the singleton when absolutely necessary. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Both the DataRepoService and the UserRepoService objects conform to the DAO design pattern. All traffic concerning users goes through the UserRepoService object whilst all training data traffic is handled by the DataRepoService. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"> The UserRepoService and DataRepoService are singletons. This is enforced by the Spring framework due to the @Service annotation above the class. It useful that these classes are singletons because they are DAO’s and all traffic to the database should be processed by only two instances of this class. To ensure the code does not become too tightly coupled, the ModelCoordinator is the only class that has access to these objects.  </p>

                        <p> The fact that CosmosDB is a documentDB allows us to save entire classes in the database instead of just fields within each class. We therefore save each User class and all its dependencies (Figure 3) in a ‘Users’ collection in the database. Similarly, the base training data is saved in the ‘trainingData’ collection in a TrainingDataSet object. </p>

                                    The user is represented by the User class and encapsulates all that the system needs to know about the user.
                                    It was decided that each user should have its individual model because allows for greater personalisation given the dataset and the ML algorithm that was applied.
                                    The alternative would have been a group model but it would have been more complex in terms of mapping personalities and training. Additionally, there wouldn’t necessarily be any accuracy benefits.
                                    It would only have been more efficient due to the higher costs of training and saving each individual model. <br><br>
                                    In terms of personal information, it was decided to keep this as simple as possible, only saving a name.
                                    This was done because the lack of knowledge with how Microsoft would want to go about identifying users and the data privacy laws that accompany this topic.
                                    The class was designed so that additional identifying fields can be retrofitted to the class on an ‘as needed’ basis.

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Large sections of the model package were imported from the open source JGibbLabelledLDA project [9]. That project was originally a command line tool which needed to be refactored into a web model.

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The ML algorithm was left untouched but Input/Output (IO) and file read/write functions needed to be updated, removing the possibility of certain exceptions being thrown. This is why a lot of the try/catch blocks could be eliminated. The ML algorithm methods were left untouched because they were still needed and the mathematics behind the implementation was beyond the scope of the project. We could have chosen to pipe input and output into the application from a second application but this would have decreased the efficiency of the system due to the increased number of operations. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">After refactoring the code, a model could be past into the estimation methods allowing the system to prepopulate the model with a dataset, something that was not possible before.</p>

                                <h3> <u> Scraper </u> </h3>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The scraper was composed of three sections of code. The first being the BoundingBoxCoordMaker, it created the polygon in which amenities were searched for. This was kept from the query formation because it allows one to change the shape or the implementation of how these boundaries are drawn much more easily. For simplicity a rectangle was chosen, however it is possible to create more complex shapes. All that would have to be altered is this class and the query formatting. The second section of the scraper is the request creation. Due to the similarity of the requests a template pattern was used to reduce code duplication. Within each subclass the unique query is built and made: </p>
                                <script src="https://gist.github.com/abcristian/c80084f74928532236dbccb1758ec0cd.js"></script>

                                <br>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The final part of the scraper is the GetTags class. This class handles the creation of the bounding box and handles all requests. It is also the only class that interacts with other components in the system. This choice was made in order to keep the coupling a low as possible and the package itself cohesive. The requests sometime return null POIInformation objects – which are useless in terms of suggestions – due to incomplete map information, due to this the GetTags class also filters out all of these objects before passing these remaining list to the requesting class. </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The Spring framework allows for the easy creation of a RESTful API through the use of class and method annotations. This was one of the reasons the framework was chosen. The APIController class was annotated with @RestController and methods were formatted as follows:</p>
                                <script src="https://gist.github.com/abcristian/4671366a9216470fc5557346a7ec0b5b.js"></script>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">The @RequestMapping annotation defines a path as well as the REST method that the method will be. Annotations of this form were made to all the methods in the APIController class to implement the API.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                We needed a way to test that individual components functioned as they should. This included testing if it was possible to make a trip with waypoints, testing if the program could convert waypoints to strings and testing if it could set up a model properly with a new data set. Our team looked at using the JUnit along with the SpringBootTest framework – as it was necessary to write simple, clean tests for functions within a SpringBoot framework.
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                Unit testing was important to our system for many different reasons, which is why the team felt it was essential to include it as part of our testing suite. There are many reasons why unit testing is appropriate for this project. For example, unit tests can test individual and very specific functions. This is good as it means the team can work in a test-driven development manner, whereby testing can occur as and when there are changes to the code. This makes our code more reusable as it encourages us to write cleanly and efficiently. Furthermore, unit testing gives reassurance that our code is reliable and will work as expected when it comes to handing the source code over to our client. Finally, writing unit tests mean that it is easier to identify minor bugs early on and allows us to correct them before our code becomes integrated.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h5 style="margin: 0">Which parts did we unit test?</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                Our team thought it would be most important to write unit tests for the key functionalities of our program. For example, a unit test for creating trips with waypoints because this is the basis of the program and a core piece of functionality.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                Also, our unit tests included a test for converting a trip to a string of places of interest, which is important because it is what will be used to present information to the user. Another unit test was for setting up a model correctly is highly important as the model is the basis of the program. Finally, there was a unit test for creating a model copy with a new data set, which is important because we need to use a new model whenever our data set changes.
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                After unit testing individual components, it was agreed within the team that it would be imperative to then test if the system could successfully link the separate components together and, perhaps most importantly, check to see if it was correctly connected to the database on Azure. Again, as with unit testing, due to the nature of our project being made with SpringBoot framework, the SpringBootTest framework and specifically its DataMongoTest class were used along with JUnit.
                            </p>

                            <h5 style="margin: 0">Why do we have integration tests?</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                Our system requires the use of a separate database: we used a CosmosDB that used the MongoDB API hosted on Azure. SpringBoot comes with functionality that allows us to easily make connections to Azure and manage the database. Integration tests were useful because they gave us confidence that we could populate an external database. Furthermore, because there were multiple developers working on this project, it was important to ensure that the different components worked together successfully, and integration tests allow us to do this well. Finally, integration tests are good for catching any bugs that were missed in unit testing, such as certain method’s side effects.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h5 style="margin: 0">How did we implement integration tests in our system?</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                Integration testing was used to primarily test that the program’s functions could successfully create and delete users from the user repository and add trips to the user repository. Integration testing was also used to see if the code could successfully populate the data repository.

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                Performance testing is used to measure the speed at which a piece of software works and how it can handle various amount of load. It can also be used to identify bottle necks in data flow through a system. It can also be synonymous with load testing.                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                Our team agreed that performance testing was certainly important as our system had to make complex calculations, calls to our database, and fetch data from the OpenStreetMaps (OSM) database. This means our team needed a way to test the latency of the system, whilst having to perform all these operations. Therefore, it was important to be able to see how our system performs under various loads – especially since there could be a high number of concurrent users on the system at any one time.
                            </p>

                                Azure comes with a performance testing feature that enables you to simulate various amounts of traffic hitting your database from different locations across the world. It then presents the response time of your database on line graph over time and then after multiple tests you can compare under what conditions your database begins to slow down with responses.

                                The changes that were observed came from when the location of incoming users was changed to West USA and South East Asia. Also, when the number of users coming from these parts of the world would drastically increase, there were drops in response time. Additionally, we learnt that although traffic from the US and Europe is quite stable, traffic from Asia is much less stable and requests fail over 34% of the time under the test conditions.

                                Stress testing is like performance testing in that you test how well your system can perform under different numbers of concurrent users and requests per minute. However, stress testing is when you are testing at extremely high numbers.                              <br>

                                Since our system requires access to the OpenStreetMaps (OSM) database, we had to see what the limits were with regards to making calls to it. Since OSM monitors the amount requests per IP address, there could be multiple users each separately making calls to the OSM database. So, our team decided it was important to test how much data could be pulled for any given request.
                                <br><br>
                                We additionally ran some stress tests on Azure to see what the effect of a high number of concurrent users on the system having would have on response time.

                                The limitation that we observed by stress testing was when you make requests for very large amount of data frequently. This results in a HTTP 429 error being thrown, after which there is a cooldown period, where you are unable to make any more requests. To prevent this, we changed the way we pull data from OSM database and implemented a new way to create a bounding box to pull data from, which greatly reduced the quantity of data.

                                    Due to the nature of our project being machine learning based and therefore more focused on back-end functionality, the team had to come up with an intuitive way to make an interactive API that would enable use of the program. Our main goal was to maximise clarity for the users, which was achieved to a great extent due to feedback from our acceptance tests. Moreover, a Swagger documentation [1] enabled us to provide examples of key queries that a user can make and examples of how data can be accessed. In terms of the API requests that a user can make, there are a lot of variables they can input into a query. Our UI is specifically designed in such a way that simplifies this input process for the user. As the user enters the API path they need to query, the field names that they must give values for are already present and are formatted correctly. The request responses are another part of the API UI and are intentionally designed to be simple and minimal. This decision was made because it is important when dealing with APIs that information is precisely presented so that it can be easily made use of in another way. For example, storing the information from a request response in a particular data structure; our API responses achieve this precision well.
                                    The team believes it achieved what it could with the UI / UX given the context of the project being innately back-end based.

                                    A clear area of weakness are the error messages that are presented to the user when something with a request goes wrong. As it currently is, the API doesn’t give error messages that help the user figure out what went wrong; only that the request simply failed somehow. For example, when creating a new user, the request fails due to something going wrong server side, the user receives the error code 500: “Error creating new user”. This does not give the user any direction as to why the request failed. There is potential to improve this by writing more specific error messages for common mistakes a user might make when making a request.

                                    Efficiency is highly important for our system because calls are always being made to two separate databases: CosmosDB on Azure and OpenStreetMap (OSM) database.  It is vital that latency remains low and the responses are received correctly and promptly as this not only improves overall user satisfaction but reduces the possibility of a backlog of requests building up waiting to be processed. The system responds quickly when the number of concurrent users making requests to the CosmosDB on Azure is below approximately 2000. Another factor that effects efficiency of the system is the location of the users when they make the request. Users being in Europe typically have the quickest response times.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In terms of the software itself effort has been made reduce the number of calls to external sources like the OSM API. During development the number of requests that needed to be made by processing similar requests concurrently. This cut back potentially resource intensive calls to this API. Finally, the way the classes are structured minimized the number of calls that need to be made to the database, something that would also slow down the system.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                    There are high increases in response times as the number of concurrent users rises above 2000 and response time increases if users are based on other continents. Efficiency is further compromised when the database is being accessed from the US or East Asia. The graphs shown on the Testing page demonstrate this, which lead us to believe that there should be a relatively small number of users from North Europe making requests at any one time for optimal efficiency. This is definitely a weakness of the efficiency of the system as although it operates well with a small number of users, the problem will exacerbate as the number of users scale in the future. This could possibly be solved by increasing the number of servers running on our system, although this would come at extra financial cost.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One main drawback in terms of efficiency is the training of the model which is time consuming and the training time increases exponentially with increases in training set size. This could become a real issue as Microsoft gathers more data. One way of solving this would be to create an object pool of pre-trained models on a base training set and select a model from there. This way the models do not have to be trained during user creation.

                                    Stability is highly important in any system that has been deployed. Since every key feature our system has depends on making calls to separate databases, it is crucial that connections remain stable and functional. Performance tests indicate that traffic from Europe and the US is relatively stable. This is good as initially most of the traffic will be coming from Europe. Another factor to consider is the stability of the OSM database. Our tests determined that as long as the requests are made for relatively small areas then the server can handle them with no issues. This leads us to believe that the stability of the OSM database is acceptable. Our team considered how we could best make requests from the OSM database, which we achieved by making the bounding box (area in which we pull data) stretch from the user’s start location and their destination location.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                    When the number of concurrent users rises above 2000 there are slight increases in the failure rate, which implies that stability becomes compromised around these levels of use. Traffic from Asia is not as stable as traffic from Europe or US and tends to have many more failed requests and thus lower stability when accessing from these regions. The graphs on the Testing page demonstrate this. Potentially, this is a cause for concern as scalability becomes an issue further down the line. Too many failed requests would create dissatisfaction amongst users and lead to a decline in the apps use. However, this is not seen to be an immediate problem as initially the feature will be used in the UK, which is where the database is hosted, so there should be less failed requests compared to if users from all over the world were accessing the database.  Also, during the development phase, we only had the resources to deploy our system on one server. Nevertheless, a possible way to dampen the problem of users accessing from far away regions would be to have multiple server locations in different regions to ensure response times for all users remains similar. Another concern is that we do not currently control how many suggestion requests a user can make within a given time period. Although the bounding box may be small, this may result in the user’s IP being blacklisted for a given period of time from the OSM API. This is concern that may need to be further explored.
                                    <br><br>
                                    It is important to note that the performance and stability of the system is a reflection of the hardware that serves the API we are interacting with. Therefore, much of the optimization is out of the team’s control.

                                    Maintainability of code is important for a number of reasons. For example, if the codebase were to be updated at any future point or for – in our case – when other developers take over, it needs to have been maintained well. Maintainability can be defined by readability and reusability of code, well-structured components, and minimal coupling between these components. In our case, we improved readability and reusability of our code by implementing design patterns, which can be seen in the design section of the website. In terms of minimising cohesion between components, we achieved this to a large extent by making our Scraper component only accessible through one class (GetTags). Additionally, the Model component was designed to be isolated as much as possible in order to achieve this minimal cohesion.

                                    Our code of course is not perfectly optimized for maintainability. One of the reasons for this is in the User class since its methods directly access fields in the Model class. This is an issue albeit a minor one because it increases coupling between classes, which is never a good thing. However, the reason for this coupling between User and Model is largely due to a lack of understanding of the mathematics behind the model. As a result of this, we weren’t able to write any tests for it, which meant that making any changes to this code would be risky as we would not be able to then test that it functions correctly still. Perhaps given more time and a greater understanding of the mathematics, we could work to reduce the coupling between User and Model.

                                    In terms of ‘Must Have’ and ‘Should Have’ requirements, our team has successfully implemented these. Furthermore, there has been extensive testing on the individual level with unit tests to ensure that functions are independently behaving correctly and then integration testing to ensure that the different components interact successfully. The acceptance testing was also useful in highlighting issues with using the API, which gave the team opportunity to improve the functionality of this.

                                    We currently can’t guarantee that the machine learning model behaves as it should. The result of which is that we can’t guarantee the suggestions that the model outputs are accurate. We can’t guarantee this because the mathematics to validate the model is beyond the scope of the project and our current skillsets.

                                    Another weakness is that the OSM has a limited set of amenities that the map is tagged with. These tags make up our dictionary of words. This limitation on the dictionary also limits the type and range of suggestions that the API can make.

                                    Due to our system being a web application, it is compatible with any architecture that allows web requests. Therefore, compatibility hasn’t been a major cause for concern during development. Moreover, the code is written in Java meaning it is portable and can be maintained on most systems due to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [2].
                                </p>

                                    The further use of our system may have important usage considerations for the (ultimately intended) mobile use. As the Microsoft application is used on mobile devices, implications such as internet connection availability, database storage and offline system availability must be taken into serious consideration. If there is no internet connection then calls cannot be made to the database to then receive inferences. One possible way this could be solved is if each mobile device has a local copy of a trained model with their user and trip data stored on a local database. However, this would be costly in terms of memory and also it doesn’t solve the issue of connecting to the external OSM database.

                                    Effective project management is crucial for any project. Without it, tasks fail to get completed on time or within the requirements. We therefore made project management a high priority. Our team has maintained good communication at all times, through regular meetings, conference calls as well as document sharing through Slack and Google Drive. This is how we have maintained effective communication and ensured that everyone is up-to-date with meeting schedules and other admin related issues. Slack also allowed us to easily use Trello, which we used to update and keep track of all the tasks that needed to be complete. Trello also helped the team to efficiently allocate tasks to its members. On the whole, the team feels that it managed its time effectively and communicated well during the course of this project.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Our team also wrote bi-weekly reports that were sent to our client, which proved to be a useful way of managing and reflecting on the work that was accomplished every two weeks. Alongside this, we had weekly Skype calls with our client, where we discussed possible directions to take the project in during the research phase and kept our client up to date with the project’s progress.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                    During the research phase, our team encountered issues with finding an appropriate model to use for our project. The issues were that we did not have access to a large enough set of training data, so it was vital that we found a model that didn’t require much data to train on. Despite having some setbacks during the research phase of this project, we eventually found an appropriate model to train and were able to begin the development phase. This was largely in part due to our weekly scheduled lab meetings, where we could openly discuss and plan what to research for the following week. In retrospect, we could have shortened the time we spent researching models if we spent a greater amount of time researching numerous models in parallel. A big limitation to this was the fact that no member of the team had a strong background in machine learning going into this project.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a result of this long research phase, it meant that we ultimately had less time to spend on the development phase. This lead to the team working intensely to fulfil the requirements on time, although the pressure encouraged the team to utilise our project management resources more. For example, to ensure, we didn’t fall further behind, we used Slack and Trello to plan out tasks that could be worked on in parallel.

                                    With regard to future functionality that could extend our project even more, the most important factor would be the collection of data for the training corpus, this would not only allow us to generate more accurate suggestions for the user, but also allow us to suggest activities from a more varied range.
                                </p><br>
                                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                    In terms of functionality the implementation of improved location filtering would be one of the areas of development. Not only would distance from the shortest route from start to destination be a discriminating factor in the filter – this currently is the distance from a point – but also for example the opening times of a particular suggestion and whether the suggestion fits with the current environmental conditions. The implementation of this would further improve the user experience.
                                </p><br>
                                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                    Optimisation and clean up would also be an area that would need to be explored. Like stated the model package is refactored academic code which still is tightly coupled. This would be one of the first packages I would look to refactor to improve the code quality to boost both efficiency and maintainability. Secondly like stated above, I would implement model object pools with pre-trained models to reduce the time needed create a new user. Finally, I would attempt reduce the number of OSM API calls even further by creating more complicated queries. Something that wasn’t yet possible as we were familiarising ourselves with the API.
                                </p><br>
                                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                    Additionally, based on the customised ‘personality types’ created, features such as the habitual locations visited by a user or the additional suggestions accepted when going to a specific amenity type can be implemented. These would greatly enhance the user experience and the system would become even more able to suggest agreeable locations.
                                </p><br>
                                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0px">
                                    Finally, security and user authentication would also be something that would be looked into. Currently this is not done due to the fact that it was not required and time did not permit it. However, security is important to consider because not only don’t we want people accidentally changing values in the system, we are also dealing with people’s personal information which brings with it several legal issues.
