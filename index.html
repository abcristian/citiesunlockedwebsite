            <h3> The Cities Unlocked project is the first of its kind, although there are mapping applications that provide speech callouts, none give the same freedom to explore a city like Cities Unlocked does. Because of the uniqueness of the project, the open requirements laid out by the client, and the lack of real-world training data, the project was as much of a research project in search for a problem as a development project creating a solution. 
           </h3>


            <ul>
              <h4><u> Discussion of Possible Problems </u></h4>
              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> A specific project direction was something that needed to be discussed and explored early on in the project, as the client hadn’t specified a particular direction. This was challenging due to the fact that the team wasn’t completely sure what was possible at that point and a balance had to be found between feasibility and utility. </li>

              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i>One idea that was put forth was a program that would spot patterns in behaviour and try to break this pattern. It was thought this would be of value to the user because they might be exposed to new activities instead of falling into a rut. Another idea was route suggestions through possible activities. The issue with the first problem was that we were unsure how best to distinguish a good habit from one that we might want to suggest an alternative for, especially without any data that can be analysed. As for the second problem, we didn’t think this fit well with the idea of the app. The app is not supposed to be a mapping tool, it should let the user explore by themselves. </li>

              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i>In the end elements of the two problems were combined. The pattern recognition aspect of the first was applied in a more general sense, it instead classifies users by personality and preference. The second problem was adapted to suggest activities in the vicinity of the user based on the personality class the user had been placed in by the first section.</li>

              <br><br>



              <h4><u>Comparison of possible solutions</u></h4>

              <h4> - Potential languages - </h4>
              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> Two languages were discussed as the language of choice for this project. Java, and Python. Both languages are used extensively throughout industry and all members of the team were familiar with both. The choice was therefore not based on the team’s familiarity with the language but on the availability of project related resources.</li>

              <br>
              <h4> - Potential Libraries - </h4>

              <h5><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> JGibbLabelledLDA</h5>
              <li>
                The JGibbLabelledLDA is a Java open-source library that implements the Labelled LDA model. The benefit of this library is that it has extensive documentation which is useful because the team does not have an in depth understanding of the LLDA model. The drawback is that compared to python, java is a lot more verbose. 
              </li>


              <h5><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i><a href="https://shuyo.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/python-implementation-of-labeled-lda-ramage-emnlp2009/"> PythonLabelledLDA</a></h5>
              <li>
             <a href="https://shuyo.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/python-implementation-of-labeled-lda-ramage-emnlp2009/"></a>
            The PythonLabelledLDA is a Python open-source library that implements the Labelled LDA model. Python allows the developer to write clear and concise code, something that is useful when prototyping, this is the library’s main benefit. Its major drawback is that documentation is lacking which makes this library hard to use.
              </li>

              <h5><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> PyMC3</h5>
              <li>
                PyMC3 is a python library for Bayesian statistical modelling that can be used to implement a BHM. The benefit of this library is that it gives the programmer a large amount of customizability whilst dealing with the complex calculations. The library however is harder to use than the other two in addition to it having a steeper learning curve for those new to statistical modelling.
              </li>

               <h5><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i>  Other libraries</h5>
              <li>
                The project makes use of other libraries however these were not researched as extensively as the three above because they did not affect the project in the same way the choice between JGibbLabelledLDA, PythonLabelledLDA, PyMC3 did. These libraries include Jackson, which is used for Java object to JSON conversions and the OSM4J library which is used to interact with OpenStreetMaps. 
               </li>
              




            </li>

            </ul>

              <h4>–<span> </span></h4>
              <p>The Cities Unlocked Project is a Microsoft and Guide Dogs UK collaboration which aims to enrich the lives of the visually impaired by allowing them to explore cities with the aid of sound. Users wear a headset and receive audio cues and callouts informing them of their surroundings. These callouts may include shops, café’s, restaurants, and other notable points of interest.</p>

              <p>We are working together with Microsoft, more specifically the Jarnail Chudge, the Project Leader, to help improve their product.</p>

              <h3>Project Goals</h3>
              <h4>–<span> </span></h4>
              <p>At the start of the project we were given a very open project description with only two things to keep in mind: the user is central, the solution needs a real-world outcome. In terms of the Cities Unlocked project we interpreted this to be improving or helping them with their experience.</p>

              <p>After discussion with our client and deliberation within the team we settled on the project goal: to help improve the user experience of the Cities Unlocked application by personalizing the information callouts based on user preferences.</p>

              <h3>Requirements Gathering</h3>
              <h4>–<span> </span></h4>
              The nature of the project required us to develop a solution from scratch. In addition, consideration had to be taken of the fact that we did not possess any training data to apply any Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to. Therefore, in discussion with the client we selected requirements that were both feasible within the timeframe and possible without the access to real-world data. More specifically, we deconstructed the problem into parts that could be viewed and worked on separately in order to give the project the best chance of success.

             <br><br>
             
              <h4><u>Front End</u></h4>
              We have exposed a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) to our application and which allows any front end to connect with the application. In this case the API was built to integrate easily into the current Cities Unlocked application.
              <br><br>
              <h4><u> Back End </u></h4>
              The application itself was built around the Spring Boot framework, packaged by Maven and hosted on an Azure Web App. The Labelled Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model (LLDA) is adapted library code to work within a web application instead of on the command line. The Spring Boot framework was chosen because it allows rapid development of enterprise level applications without too much up front configuration.
              <br><br>
              <h4><u> Database </u></h4>
              The Spring Boot framework allows for easy communication with MongoDB. Due to this, and the form of the information that needed to be saved we chose to use Azure CosmosDB, a documentDB that supported the MongoDB API allowing us to use it alongside Spring. The database contains two collections: Users and trainingData.

             <h3> <u>Class Diagram </u> </h3>
              <p class="description"> The following section presents several class diagrams of key areas of the code. These diagrams have been split up to improve readability because representing the entire system on one diagram is not feasible. </p>

              <br><br>
              <p>This section is vital because it is the section of code that exposes the endpoints and all information going in and out of the application passes through it. The classes in the controllers package conform to the Front-Controller Pattern [Citation Needed] as to ensure loose coupling of the endpoints and the system. The ModelCoordinator serves as a Mediator, all of the system’s behaviour is delegated by it.</p>

              <p>This section is key due to the fact that this is the section that adapts to user input and interaction, it defines a large part of the functionality of the system. The User class represents the user in the system and has its own model assigned to it. By calling methods on the user object the model learns and adapts. The model package includes several other classes that are used to help train the model however these are omitted for succinctness. What is shown in both user and model packages are the classes that persist in the database.</p>

              <p>This section of code gives the application the ability to suggest personalized activities in different areas and is therefore key to the functionality of the system. The scraper package is cohesive and very loosely coupled with the rest of the code, the tagGetter method is only called once in the rest of the code. </p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Design patterns</h3>
            <span class="section-divider"></span>
             <br><br>

             <h4><ins> Template Method </ins></h4>
              <p>The Template Method design pattern is a behavioural design pattern that allows common elements of similarly structured classes to be defined and consequently specialised by subclasses [1]. This promotes both loose coupling and reduces the duplication of code. The Template Method pattern promotes loose coupling of classes as well as reduces the duplication of code. However, it does limit one to use the skeleton of the existing superclass. Additionally, maintainability decreases as the number of methods increases [2]. </p>

              <h4> Where we applied it: </h4>
              <p>The Template Method design pattern was applied to the classes in the requests sub-package of the scraper package. The initial decision was made to do this because the current subclasses duplicated a lot of code that could be factored out without introducing unnecessary coupling. </p>
              <br><br>

              <hr>
              
              <h4><ins> Front controller </ins></h4>
              <p>The Front Controller (FC) pattern is a variation of the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern in which all traffic is channelled through a single controller [3]. The MVC design pattern is an architectural pattern that separates the concerns of maintaining the User Interface (UI), the Model, and handling interactions between the two – the controller [4]. The benefits of a the FC Pattern is that duplication is reduced because all requests are handled in one place. Secondly, due to the centralized controller, thread safety is increased. Finally, is dynamic dispatching is employed, coupling can be reduced. There are however a few drawbacks of the pattern, one of which is that the controller may become a performance bottleneck. This is certainly a concern at high load and due to the nature of the application something that needs to be looked into. Another consideration is the added complexity of implementing the FC pattern, this is however handled by the Spring framework and less of a concern [5]. </p>

              <h4> Where we applied it: </h4>
              <p> The Spring boot framework intrinsically uses the Front Controller pattern for web development. The APIController class is the controller and appropriately annotated with @RestController. Any view interacts with this APIController class which in turn interacts with the model. It also updates the view with any changes in the model. </p>
              <br><br>

              <hr>

              <h4><ins> Factory method </ins></h4>
              <p>The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows one to create objects without having to know the class or how to create it. An interface is defined and subclasses dictate how certain classes are instantiated through factory methods. This accommodates the configuration of the created object whilst hiding the complexity from the class that requires this object. The benefits of the factory method pattern are that it improves code readability by improving encapsulation and secondly if used well can decrease coupling through the use of the interface. In the case of the program allows the representation of the user to be changed without having to edit all the methods. The drawback is that coupling increases between the factory and the product i.e. the user, additionally as more types of product arise the maintainability of the factory is more tedious [6]. </p>

              <h4> Where we applied it: </h4>
              <p> All users within the system are created using a UserFactory. This is because the creation of a user requires a lot of configuration and users differ based on the configuration options that are sent in the request body. It is beneficial to hide this complexity from the ModelCoordinator class where Users are created because it concerns itself with the creation of the User object, not how they are created. </p>
              <br><br>

              <hr>

              <h4><ins> Data access object </ins></h4>
              <p>The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern abstracts and encapsulates the system’s interactions with a database. Additionally, it manages the connection that the system maintains with the database. There are several benefits to this pattern. Firstly, it decreases coupling with the database, this is beneficial because it makes enables easier migration and separates the concern of database implementation from the business logic. Secondly, it centralises all data access into a separate layer and reduces the complexity within the business layer by doing so. This is also a potential drawback, the DAO hides the expense at which these database calls are made [7]. In an application that makes database calls on each API request, this is definitely a concern. </p>

              <h4> Where we applied it: </h4>
              <p> Both the DataRepoService and the UserRepoService objects conform to the DAO design pattern. All traffic concerning users goes through the UserRepoService object whilst all training data traffic is handled by the DataRepoService. </p>
              <br><br>

              <hr>

              

              <h4><ins> Singleton </ins></h4>
              <p>The Singleton pattern is ensures that only one instance of an class can be instantiated. This is useful when it is imperative that only one of these objects exist in a system [8]. Singletons are a controversial design pattern however they are beneficial when an object is resource intense and the misuse of it or there being multiple instances of this object would introduce bugs. However the main drawback of the Singleton pattern is that code can become tightly coupled. It is therefore important to only make calls to the singleton when absolutely necessary. </p>

              <h4> Where we applied it: </h4>
              <p> The UserRepoService and DataRepoService are singletons. This is enforced by the Spring framework due to the @Service annotation above the class. It useful that these classes are singletons because they are DAO’s and all traffic to the database should be processed by only two instances of this class. To ensure the code does not become too tightly coupled, the ModelCoordinator is the only class that has access to these objects.  </p>

              <hr>



            <h3> <u>Data storage </u> </h3>
             <p> The fact that CosmosDB is a documentDB allows us to save entire classes in the database instead of just fields within each class. We therefore save each User class and all its dependencies (Figure 3) in a ‘Users’ collection in the database. Similarly, the base training data is saved in the ‘trainingData’ collection in a TrainingDataSet object. </p>

            <h3 class="section-title"> Key functionalities </h3>
            <span class="section-divider"></span>
             <p> This section summarises the key functionalities of the project and discusses any design decisions made in the process. </p>
              <br><br>

           <h3> <u>User </u> </h3>
             <p> The user is represented by the User class (Figure 3) and encapsulates all that the system needs to know about the user. It was decided that each user should have its individual model because allows for greater personalisation given the dataset and the ML algorithm that was applied. The alternative would have been a group model but it would have been more complex in terms of mapping personalities and training. Additionally, there wouldn’t necessarily be any accuracy benefits. It would only have been more efficient due to the higher costs of training and saving each individual model. <br> In terms of personal information, it was decided to keep this as simple as possible, only saving a name. This was done because the lack of knowledge with how Microsoft would want to go about identifying users and the data privacy laws that accompany this topic. The class was designed so that additional identifying fields can be retrofitted to the class on an ‘as needed’ basis.
              </p>   
           
            <h3> <u>Model </u> </h3>
             <p> Large sections of the model package were imported from the open source JGibbLabelledLDA project [9]. That project was originally a command line tool which needed to be refactored into a web model. 
             </p>  

            Original LDA Code 
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/abcristian/e0e7d5285e5684b72883ebd3be91543f.js"></script>

            Refactored LDA Code
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/abcristian/456a8c5aece4e9c77c82b078987663d8.js"></script>

            <br><br>

            <p> The ML algorithm was left untouched but Input/Output (IO) and file read/write functions needed to be updated, removing the possibility of certain exceptions being thrown. This is why a lot of the try/catch blocks could be eliminated. The ML algorithm methods were left untouched because they were still needed and the mathematics behind the implementation was beyond the scope of the project. We could have chosen to pipe input and output into the application from a second application but this would have decreased the efficiency of the system due to the increased number of operations. </p>

            <p> After refactoring the code, a model could be past into the estimation methods allowing the system to prepopulate the model with a dataset, something that was not possible before.</p>

            <hr><br><br>

           <h3> <u> Scraper </u> </h3>
              
              <p>The scraper was composed of three sections of code. The first being the BoundingBoxCoordMaker, it created the polygon in which amenities were searched for. This was kept from the query formation because it allows one to change the shape or the implementation of how these boundaries are drawn much more easily. For simplicity a rectangle was chosen, however it is possible to create more complex shapes. All that would have to be altered is this class and the query formatting. The second section of the scraper is the request creation. Due to the similarity of the requests a template pattern was used to reduce code duplication. Within each subclass the unique query is built and made: </p>
              <script src="https://gist.github.com/abcristian/c80084f74928532236dbccb1758ec0cd.js"></script>
              
              <br>

              <p> The final part of the scraper is the GetTags class. This class handles the creation of the bounding box and handles all requests. It is also the only class that interacts with other components in the system. This choice was made in order to keep the coupling a low as possible and the package itself cohesive. The requests sometime return null POIInformation objects – which are useless in terms of suggestions – due to incomplete map information, due to this the GetTags class also filters out all of these objects before passing these remaining list to the requesting class. </p>
            
              Filter
              <script src="https://gist.github.com/abcristian/3ba059265f10e6edd0439316f1c5c6d3.js"></script>
              <br><br>
           

           <h3> <u> API Endpoints </u> </h3>
           <p> The Spring framework allows for the easy creation of a RESTful API through the use of class and method annotations. This was one of the reasons the framework was chosen. The APIController class was annotated with @RestController and methods were formatted as follows:</p>
           <script src="https://gist.github.com/abcristian/4671366a9216470fc5557346a7ec0b5b.js"></script>

           <p>The @RequestMapping annotation defines a path as well as the REST method that the method will be. Annotations of this form were made to all the methods in the APIController class to implement the API.</p>
